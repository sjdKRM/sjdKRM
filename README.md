As a passionate learner and aspiring quantitative developer, I am dedicated to advancing my expertise in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance. With a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering, I am currently focused on mastering trading strategies, portfolio management, and financial modeling through academic courses and practical projects.

I have completed specialized courses in algorithmic trading, quantitative strategy development, and corporate finance, gaining skills in trading algorithm optimization, portfolio risk management, and data-driven decision-making. Currently enrolled in the Executive Programme in Algorithmic Trading (EPAT), I am further honing my skills in advanced trading technologies and market analysis.

Beyond coursework, I actively engage in coding challenges and projects, leveraging platforms like GitHub and LeetCode to enhance my programming and problem-solving abilities. I am skilled in Python, R, and financial libraries, with a focus on creating efficient and robust trading systems.

Driven by a commitment to innovation, I aim to contribute to the quantitative finance domain by building impactful trading solutions. I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate and develop as a quant developer in dynamic and forward-thinking environments.
